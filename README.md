Daffodil provides native multi-targeting platform toolsets for 
Visual Studio 2010 C++ developers who need to target older versions 
of Visual Studio from within the Visual Studio 2010 IDE.

Currently supported target platforms are:

- Visual Studio 2008 (VC 9)
- Visual Studio 2005 (VC 8)
- Visual Studio 2003 (VC 7.1)
- Visual Studio 2002 (VC 7)
- Visual Studio 6 (VC 6)

Daffodil works fine in Visual Studio 2012/2013/2015 IDEs as long as 
Visual Studio 2010 is also installed.
